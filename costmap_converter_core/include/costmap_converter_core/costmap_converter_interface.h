 * @class BaseCostmapToPolygons
 * @brief This abstract class defines the interface for plugins that convert the costmap into polygon types
 *
 * Plugins must accept a costmap_2d::Costmap2D datatype as information source.
 * The interface provides two different use cases:
 * 1. Manual call to conversion routines: setCostmap2D(), compute() and getPolygons()
 *    (in subsequent calls setCostmap2D() can be substituted by updateCostmap2D())
 * 2. Repeatedly process costmap with a specific rate (startWorker() and stopWorker()):
 *    Make sure that the costmap is valid while the worker is active (you can specify your own spinner or activate a threaded spinner).
 *    Costmaps can be obtained by invoking getPolygons().
 *
 * @todo allow different plugins for both static and dynamic obstacles (arbitrary combinations)
